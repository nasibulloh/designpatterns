# Prototype Pattern
The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, 
known as the prototype. It's useful when creating new instances is resource-intensive or when you want to avoid repetitive initialization of objects with similar properties.

Here's a basic explanation of how the Prototype Pattern works:

## Intent:
To create new objects by copying an existing object (prototype) rather than creating them from scratch.

## Components:

1. Prototype: This is the interface or abstract class that defines the cloning method, which is used to create new
objects by copying the prototype. Concrete prototypes implement the cloning method.
